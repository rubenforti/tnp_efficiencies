----------

First glance on the tracking(plus) data, early evaluations are repoted below;
the starting point for this analysis is the software version inherited from 
Master Thesis (last commit on 4th october 2023).

i1) Implemented the cmsshape as bkg pdf
i2) External constraints implemented into the "fitter" classes

p1) The passing probes (on OS data) have the expected shape, while the failing
    ones not everywhere show a clear resonant peak.
p2) The main background source is SameCharge (to be renamed SS_data?), while 
    the others are negligible, especially for the failing probes.
p3) In some cases, for failing probes, the SameCharge bkg is of the same order
    of the data: this, together with the 1) point, suggests that the fits on 
    these bins can be delicate.
p4) Fit routine with default settings (cmsshape bkg for failing probes): 
    noticed that in many cases, while the fit converges and all the quality 
    controls are satisfied, some parameters are at limit.
     
Developed some ideas to implement an alternative efficiency estimation:
s1) For the passing probes (OS data), the background can be taken from the 
    SS_data; from that histogram, the SS_mc_signal has to be subtracted, in
    order to not count the events with a mis-assigned charge. (Here we are
    assuming Scale_factor~1)
s2) For the failing probes, we can get rid of the fit procedure by directly 
    counting the number of OS and SS data events:
        Nsig_fail = (Ntot_OS - Ntot_SS)/(1-f),  f = N_mcSig(SS)/N_mcSig(OS+SS) 
        a1) The number of bkg events estimated in the SS region has to be the
            same (almost) as the number of bkg events in the OS region: this
            can be checked by comparing events in the MC (when present) and by
            studying the SS_data population the sidebands.
        a2) The scale factor affects the contribution of the parameter "f"; at
            this order we can assume f~1, but the impact of deviations has to
            be checked.
    The number Nsig_fail so extracted can be used directly in the formula for
    the efficiency, OR as a medium/tight constraint for the fit procedure.

In order to improve the robustness of the implementation of s1) and s2), new
samples are needed:
    - TTSemileptonic -> requested via CRAB
    - Signal MC low mass -> requested via CRAB
    - Data (OS and SS) -> mass range has to be expanded in Steve

----------

Restyling in the procedure of dataset generation: 
  - a function manages the import dictionary
  - possibility of explicitly import the mc_SS and bkg_SS datasets
  - possibility of import only the total background

The base settings are tested and the funcions work as expected. Need to put an
eye on adapting conveniently the other functions, especially regarding plots
and corrections to the total background.

Evaluation of backgrounds on all the bins, stored in the "tracking_figs" folder
